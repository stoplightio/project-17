# Core Configurations

The core assets essential for a fully functional banking platform such as Skaleet, encompass a diverse range of inventories and repositories that necessitate meticulous configuration. These assets are the backbone of the platform, ensuring seamless operations and delivering value to both financial institutions and their customers. 

Among these core assets are the product directory, essential information about financial products and services; the payment execution engine, responsible for processing transactions securely and efficiently; documents and templates for regulatory compliance and customer communication; API management tools for seamless integration with external systems; job scheduling capabilities for automated tasks; and customizable configurations tailored to meet specific banking requirements. 

# Documents Configuration
Document configuration in a Skaleet platform plays a crucial role in ensuring regulatory compliance, data accuracy, and efficient customer communication. By configuring document management effectively, skaleet can enhance operational efficiency, reduce errors, and maintain a high level of transparency and compliance with regulatory standards.
