5. **Remittance and Money Transfer Services**: Offering domestic and international money transfer services, allowing users to send electronic money to others quickly and securely.

6. **Merchant Services**: Facilitating merchants to accept electronic money as payment for goods and services. This can include providing point-of-sale (POS) systems, QR code scanning capabilities, or online payment gateways.

7. **Financial Products and Services**: Distributors may partner with financial institutions to offer additional financial products such as loans, insurance, savings accounts, and investment options directly from the electronic money platform.

8. **Loyalty Programs and Incentives**: Developing loyalty programs or incentives to reward users for using electronic money services. This could include cashback offers, discounts, or points that can be redeemed for goods and services.

9. **Digital Goods and Services Marketplace**: Creating a platform where users can directly purchase digital goods and services, such as mobile data, digital content, or online courses, using their electronic money.

By developing these services, distributors can significantly enhance the accessibility and utility of electronic money for a wide range of users, fostering greater financial inclusion and encouraging the adoption of digital financial services.

### Use the Distributor API
To use this API, you need to create (or use, if already created) a distributor and its delegate user. Each users are attached to a user profile which define their rights and permissions. The distributor profile configuration and the delegate user profile configuration will impact the authorization to endpoints.

API keys are generated by the back-office through their web portal. The authorization mode depends on the method used to generate the API key. When creating or editing the API key, the back-office can specify the scopes available for this key, determining whether access to specific endpoints is authorized or not.


This API can be used with other API such as  [Service Domain API (SD)](https://api.skaleet.com/docs/api/h2ac47ejqi32d-service-domain-api) which provides generic features available on the platform. The application can use a token generated by the authentication method of the distributor API to access to the SD API.  Itâ€™s not necessary to be authenticated on SD API to use it as soon as you have been authenticated on an other API providing the right scopes.  

The Distributor API allows you to discover the payment solutions and financial services we offer: acquiring, card issuing, bank transfer SEPA, KYC/KYB managementâ€¦
